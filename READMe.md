## Summary
This is a complete RESTFUL api using nodejs and expressjs which uses all http verbs(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH). I implemented this 
backend functionality to integrate it with my app using MEANSTACK.

**bookRoute.js**
This is the main file in Routes directory which contains the functionality of http verbs

**bookModels.js**
This file in models directory contains the moongoose schema for mongodb

**Usage**
Run mongodb and create a database called "restful_db" and collection named as "random" or use your own if you would like. Remember to change
the port you are running on. 

**Package.json**

I have saved all the npm packages that will be needed in package.json. Go to the main directory and use

```
npm install
```
